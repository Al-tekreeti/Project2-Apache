Important
Adding an S3 access point to a bucket doesn't change the bucket's behavior when accessed through the existing bucket name or ARN. All existing operations against the bucket will continue to work as before. Restrictions that you include in an access point policy apply only to requests made through that access point.

Important
All types of policies — IAM user policies, endpoint policies, S3 bucket policies, and Amazon S3 ACL policies (if any) — must grant the necessary permissions for access to Amazon S3 to succeed.
